# 🍄 Shroom Sounds 🍄
This soundpack is heavily inspired by [CookiesSounds](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/ChocolateCookies/CookiesSounds/). Think of this soundpack as a slightly updated version.

Currently at 216 sounds. More sound changes will come soon!

# Configs
Configs have been added as of version 1.4.0!
- Use the configs to pick and choose which sounds you'd like to enable / disable
- The configs are made in such a way that setting a config to "TRUE" always ENABLES the sound(s) while setting a config to "FALSE" always DISABLES the sound(s)
  - For example, unchecking the "FamilyFriendly" config will DISABLE all non-family friendly sounds.
  - Another example, unchecking the "DMCA" config will DISABLE all potentially copyrighted sounds.
- You can find the DMCA config in the "_Main" category of the config.
- You can disable the chance for vanilla sounds to play in the "Music" and "Interface" categories
